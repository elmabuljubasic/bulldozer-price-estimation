**Predicting Bulldozer Sale Prices**
This project focuses on predicting the future sale price of bulldozers based on their characteristics and previous auction sale data. The dataset used in this project is from the Kaggle Blue Book for Bulldozers competition, which can be accessed here.

**Problem Overview**
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sale price of a bulldozer, given its features and previous auction data for similar bulldozers. The key challenge is to develop a model that minimizes the error in predicting the sale price.

**Evaluation Metric**
The evaluation metric for this competition is the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) between the actual and predicted auction prices. RMSLE is used to penalize predictions that are far from the actual values, especially when predicting low prices. For more information on the evaluation metric, visit the Kaggle Blue Book for Bulldozers Evaluation page.

**Goal**
The main goal is to develop a machine learning model that minimizes RMSLE by making accurate predictions about bulldozer sale prices. By reducing this error, the model will be better at predicting the sale price based on the bulldozer's attributes and auction history.
